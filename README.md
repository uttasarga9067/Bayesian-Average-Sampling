# Bayesian-Average-Sampling
### Predicting Area of a building in a Zip Code, with the help of the data available; having Zip Code, State and Area available of various buildings. 
I was given a task to predict Area of various buildings of a state with the help of given the data present in hand. There were 50 States with Zip codes and Area of a particular building in each state. I was exploring various options to perform this particular task, such as using PyMC3 or PyStan and build a predictor; but when I explored and found this mamazing BAS(Bayesian Adaptive Sampling) Package, I decided to learn and use R for this Model.
## 1. Training the Model with the Data present
